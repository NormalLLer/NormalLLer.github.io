## Brief Introduction

Hello, I’m *NormalLLer* and I’m an undergraduate student at Beihang University in China.

I’ve dived into the area of <u>Computer Science</u> for nearly 3 years. I’ve always been interested in coding. In details, I hava coding experiences using programming languages including C/C++, Python, Java, SQL (MySQL, SQLite), Ruby and MATLAB. Currently, I am mainly studying in two areas, <u>software development</u> and <u>deep learning (especially in NLP)</u>. In terms of software development, I had experience using Flask, Ruby On Rails and SpringCloud development; and in terms of deep learning, which is what I am currently learning and researching in, I mainly focus on speech related fields.

I hope you enjoy my blog posts as much as I enjoy writing it!
